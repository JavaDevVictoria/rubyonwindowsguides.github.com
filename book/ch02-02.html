      <h2>Building Ruby</h2>
<p>RubyInstaller project doesn&#8217;t provide Ruby installers only. It creates development environment, based on free MinGW tool-chain, that can be used to build Ruby and its components. Project consists of number of Rake tasks aim to build, test and package Ruby.</p>
<p>Before we start to explore these tasks we have to clone RubyInstaller project.  Open up new Command Prompt or Git bash shell or, if you have followed instructions from the book, hit <code>Ctrl-F2</code> in Console2. Go to our projects directory created in the previous chapter and clone project from GitHub (<code>git://github.com/oneclick/rubyinstaller.git</code>). The whole process in Git&#8217;s bash shell should look something like this:</p>
<div>
<pre><code class='bash'>$ mkdir projects
<p>$ cd projects/<br />
$ git clone git://github.com/oneclick/rubyinstaller.git<br />
Cloning into rubyinstaller&#8230;<br />
remote: Counting objects: 3113, done.<br />

Resolving deltas: 100% (1758/1758), done.<br />
$ cd rubyinstaller</code></pre></p>
</div>
<p>Now when you have complete RubyInstaller&#8217;s code it is time to check what Rake tasks it defines. Open your Ruby Console (<code>Ctrl-F4</code> in our Console2), go to the directory where you have cloned RubyInstaller&#8217;s repository and type <code>rake -T</code>.</p>
<div>
<pre><code class='bat'>C:\&amp;gt;cd projects\ruby\rubyinstaller
<p>C:\projects\ruby\rubyinstaller&gt;rake -T<br />
(in C:/projects/ruby/rubyinstaller)<br />
You need the rdoc and rdoc_chm gems installed<br />
in order to build the docs tasks.<br />
rake book              # Download and extract The Book of Ruby<br />
rake check             # Run tests for the interpreter in the sandbox.<br />
rake clean             # Remove any temporary products.<br />
rake clobber           # Remove any generated file.<br />
rake default           # Build Ruby 1.8<br />
rake devkit            # Build DevKit installer and/or archives.<br />
rake irb               # Test drive the sandbox (using <span class="caps">IRB</span>).<br />
rake ruby18            # compile Ruby 1.8<br />
rake ruby18:install    # install rubyinstaller-1.8.6-p398.exe<br />
rake ruby18:package    # generate rubyinstaller-1.8.6-p398.exe<br />
rake ruby18:repackage  # rebuild rubyinstaller-1.8.6-p398.exe<br />
rake ruby19            # compile Ruby 1.9<br />
rake ruby19:install    # install rubyinstaller-1.9.2-p-1.exe<br />
rake ruby19:package    # generate rubyinstaller-1.9.2-p-1.exe<br />
rake ruby19:repackage  # rebuild rubyinstaller-1.9.2-p-1.exe</code></pre></p>
</div>
<p>The most important tasks in the list are rake ruby18 and rake ruby19. As their description denotes, they build Ruby 1.8 and 1.9 respectively. How that can be done when we do not have sources and build environment, you might ask. RubyInstaller automates the whole process of downloading build tools, configuring build environment, downloading sources and additional libraries needed for building Ruby and finally compiling it.</p>
<p>A list of all packages RubyInstaller uses is kept in <code>config\ruby_installer.rb</code> file. Here is excerpt of file related to Ruby 1.8:</p>
<div>
<pre><code class='ruby'>Ruby18 = OpenStruct.new(
:version =&gt; &#8216;1.8.7-p330&#8217;,
:url =&gt; &quot;http://ftp.ruby-lang.org/pub/ruby/1.8&quot;,

:configure_options =&gt; [

],

<p>)</code></pre></p>
</div>
<p>First Ruby version is defined, after that <span class="caps">URL</span> from which archive will be downloaded. Checkout options are used if we want to build Ruby not from archives, but from the Subversion repository. After that directory where sources will be unpacked is defined and it is followed by build and install directories. The install directory here doesn&#8217;t mean directory where Ruby will be installed by installer. It is directory within RubyInstaller output directory where all Ruby files needed for installer to be packed will be copied. Next option is important for build process since it defines configuration flags passed to <code>configure</code> script.</p>
<p>But what <code>configure</code> script is? This script is used to query the system on which it is run for platform architecture, build and run-time dependencies, system environment, etc. Based on gathered information configure script generates Makefile which is then used to build application. This process is common to Linux but might look strange to Windows developers. Script accepts arguments and these arguments are defined in the configure_options part. Even though you can change configure options directly in the ruby_installer.rb file there is a much better way which we will explain soon.</p>
<p>Next three options in RubyInstaller&#8217;s configuration file define full name of archive with Ruby sources, libraries that Ruby depends on and excluded library. Last two options are not important at the moment so we will skip them. Similar set of options is defined for Ruby 1.9 and subset of these options is used for other packages used during build process.</p>
<p>Now I will briefly walk you through other Rake tasks which are important if you decide to build Ruby from sources. RubyInstaller unpacks sources and builds libraries and Ruby in the sandbox folder. Tasks clean and clobber are used to remove temporary and all files created during build process respectively. Running tests on freshly built Ruby is done with check task and if you want to try Ruby you can use irb task to start new irb session in the sandbox.</p>
<p>You already saw how to choose which version of Ruby will be built but you can alter build procedure by passing “arguments” to Rake task. Actually RubyInstaller does not use Rake way of passing parameters. Namely, if Rake task is defined in such a way that it accepts parameters it is invoked with parameter value enclosed in brackets:</p>
<div>
<pre><code class='bash'>rake namespace:task_name[param]</code></pre>
</div>
<p>RubyInstaller on the hand uses environment variables as input parameters. There are several environment variables that RubyInstaller&#8217;s Rake tasks understand but most important for us at the moment are: <code>LOCAL</code>, <code>NODEPS</code> and <code>DKVER</code>. First environment variable, <code>LOCAL</code>, should hold the path where we keep sources from which Ruby will be built. In other words if we do not want to leave to RubyInstaller to download Ruby sources for particular version we can do that manually and then tell RubyInstaller where are they. As a matter of act this is the way we will build Ruby later. The second environment variable tells RubyInstaller to skip building dependencies and the third one which compiler tool-chan it should use.</p>
<p>Up to now we didn&#8217;t say anything about compiler that is used to build Ruby except that MinGW based tool-chain is used. It is now time to take a closer look which compilers are available. File <code>001_dkcompiler_init.rb</code> in the <code>config\compilers</code> directory within RubyInstaller project keeps a list of compilers that can be used:</p>
<div>
<pre><code class='ruby'>module DevKitInstaller
puts &quot;Initializing DevKit compilers&quot; if Rake.application.options.trace
<span class="caps">COMPILERS</span> = {}
<ol>
	<li><span class="caps">TODO</span> update this list when adding any new compiler or compiler version!</li>
	<li>The format is a String consisting of vendor-bits-version<br />
  VALID_COMPILERS = [<br />
    &#8216;tdm-32-4.5.1&#8217;,<br />
    &#8216;tdm-32-4.5.0&#8217;,<br />
    &#8216;tdm-64-4.5.1&#8217;,<br />
    &#8216;llvm-32-2.8&#8217;,<br />
    &#8216;mingw-32-3.4.5&#8217;<br />
  ]</li>
</ol>
<p>end</code></pre></p>
</div>
<p>As you can see available compilers are: <code>TDM-4.5.1</code> 32 and 64 bit version, <code>LLVM 2.8</code> and <code>MinGW 3.4.5</code>. The latest one is kept mainly for building Ruby 1.8.7. Default version that will be used is <code>TDM-32-4.5.1</code>.</p>
<p>Before we build latest Ruby development version I owe you one more explanation. I mentioned a way that you can alter default project setting without a need to change RubyInstaller&#8217;s code. During build, RubyInstaller checks for existence of override directory within your RubyInstaller project directory. If it finds it all Ruby files from that folder are loaded and you can use this to change project settings. Code that loads these ruby files looks like:</p>
<div>
<pre><code class='ruby'># scan all override definitions and load them
<p>Dir.glob(&#8216;override/*.rb&#8217;).sort.each do |f|<br />
  begin<br />
    require f<br />
  rescue StandardError =&gt; e<br />
    warn &quot;<span class="caps">WARN</span>: Problem loading #{f}: #{e.message}&quot;<br />
  end<br />
end</code></pre></p>
</div>
<p>Therefore if we want to change, for example, which level of optimization compiler uses when it builds application we can do it by creating file <code>optimization.rb</code> within override directory with just one line of code:</p>
<div>
<pre><code class='ruby'>RubyInstaller::Ruby19.configure_options &amp;lt;&amp;lt; “optflags='-O0'”</code></pre>
</div>
<p>If you remember <code>configure_options</code> is an array in the Ruby19 <code>OpenStruct</code> object. This array holds arguments that will be passed to <code>configure</code> script when it is invoked. Line given above just adds one more item to the <code>configure_options</code> array. But wouldn&#8217;t it be nice that we can conditionally use new arguments? Let&#8217;s improve code a little bit:</p>
<div>
<pre><code class='ruby'>if ENV[“OPTIM”] then
puts &#8216;[<span class="caps">INFO</span>] Changing compile optimization flags&#8217;
RubyInstaller::Ruby19.configure_options &lt;&lt; “optflags=&#8216;-O0&#8217;”
<p>end</code></pre></p>
</div>
<p>Now our script checks whether environment variable <code>OPTIM</code> is defined and only if it is configure_options are changed. Starting Rake task in a standard way <code>rake ruby19</code> will use default RubyInstaller settings but with <code>rake ruby19 OPTIM=1</code> changes from our script will be applied. Due to the way how Ruby treats expressions in if statement you can put anything after equals sign except nil and false. Same way is used to change <code>LOCAL</code>, <code>NODEPS</code> and <code>DKVER</code> environment variables during Rake tasks invocation.</p>
<p>As stated above we will build latest Ruby development version. Since RubyInstaller uses latest official releases we have to download sources by ourself. We can do that by telling RubyInstaller to checkout sources from Ruby Subversion repository (by defining <code>TRUNK</code> environment variable) or telling it where sources are located on our disk. As you might already expect we will use second option. First we will clone Git mirror of Ruby Subversion repository which can be found on GitHub (<code>git://github.com/ruby/ruby.git</code>). Open Bit bash shell in Console2 (<code>Ctrl-F2</code>) and clone Ruby sources in <code>C:\projects\ruby-mirror</code> directory.</p>
<div>
<pre><code class='bash'>$ cd projects/
<p>$ git clone git://github.com/ruby/ruby.git ruby-mirror<br />
Cloning into ruby-mirror&#8230;<br />
remote: Counting objects: 195052, done.<br />
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (40038/40038), done.<br />
remote: Total 195052 (delta 154907), reused 192277 (delta 153469)<br />
Receiving objects: 100% (195052/195052), 67.98 MiB | 926 KiB/s, done.<br />
Resolving deltas: 100% (154907/154907), done.</code></pre></p>
</div>
<p>Finally start <code>ruby19</code> task with <code>LOCAL</code> variable set to the full path where you just cloned Ruby sources <code>rake ruby19 LOCAL=”c:\projects\ruby-mirror”</code> Now you just have to be patient while RubyInstaller downloads compiler tool-chain, dependencies, builds them and finally configures and builds Ruby. Time needed for all this depends on speed of your network connection and a speed of your processor. After build is finished you can run <code>rake check</code> which will run all tests. Some tests will fail, but don&#8217;t worry. That&#8217;s expected. When build is finished you will find latest version of Ruby 1.9.3dev in the <code>sandbox\ruby19_mingw</code> folder. Let&#8217;s copy this folder to <code>C:\Ruby</code> and rename it to <code>1.9.3dev</code>. If you remember first Ruby version was installed in the <code>C:\Ruby\1.9.2</code> folder. This way we are putting all Rubies in the same root directory.</p>
<p>Adding this version to Console2 will let us easily switch between different Ruby versions. However we haven&#8217;t installed it through installer so we need to copy <code>resources\installer\setrbvars.bat</code> file to <code>C:\Ruby\1.9.3dev\bin</code> directory. Now open Settings dialog box in Console2 and go to Tabs section, add new tab and for Shell insert:</p>
<div>
<pre><code class='bat'>C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe /E:ON /K c:\Ruby\192\bin\setrbvars.bat</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Set Title to Ruby 193 dev console. This is fifth tab added to Console2, so it can be opened with <code>Ctrl-F5</code>.</p>
